# vlsi_project

This is a template for the digital VLSI design project. It contains a complete
design flow for an N-bit digital divider. The project includes 2 folder:
- divder: the main folder of the design project
- document: the related PDF documents

## Prerequisite: linux development environment
It is very important for users to get familiar with the Linux development
enviornment, because people always work on Linux instead of Windows in the
digital circuit domain. At least, you should be able to know some basic
operations in Linux, such as:
- `ls`: list all the files in the current folder
- `cd`: change the working directory to a new location
- `cp`: copy the specified file to a new location
- `mv`: move the specified file to a new location
- `mkdir`: create a new directory in the specified location
- `rm`: remove a specified file or a specified directory
- `chmod`: change the access permission to the specified files
- `less` or `more`: view the content of a specified file
- `find`: find the specified files or directories under a specified location
- `grep`: find the specified pattern in the contents of files
- `tar`: compress or un-compress of files into or from an archive
There is a more detailed explanation called 'linux_command.pdf' under
the `document` directory. You can find more detailed infomantion there.
